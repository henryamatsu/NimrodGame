Nimrod is a 2D game built in Unity where you jump between platforms and dodge deadly obstacles in a perilous attempt to scale the Tower of Babel. The faster you climb each floor, and the more close calls you have with traps, the more points you collect as you go. Every floor is randomly generated, so no two playthroughs are the same. Give it a whirl, and see if you can get past level 5!
